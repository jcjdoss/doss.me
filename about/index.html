                <p><mark>Built the design with Claude</mark>. Iterated the writing with AI. Shipped faster because of it.</p>
                <p>I'm explicit about this because hiding it seems pointless. AI is revolutionizing work. I use it to ship faster and think better.</p>
                <ul>

            <div class="authenticity-content">
                <p>I'm J. I'm 51. I live in Oakhurst, California—a small town in the Sierra foothills near Yosemite.</p>
                <p>I think in systems because of how my brain works (ADHD), not despite it. My perspective solves problems that homogeneous teams get stuck on—pattern recognition, systems design, seeing connections others miss. It's a feature, not a limitation.</p>
                <p>15+ years in IT and technology leadership. I've worked in government, built startups, managed teams scaling from chaos to clarity. Currently leading Client Services for Madera County. I'm married to Chrissie. Two adult sons. I cook seriously—Traeger, sous vide—and build iOS apps when I have space to think.</p>
                <p><mark>Building in public</mark> now—doss.me, @whatmefocus, my thinking notebook. Transparent about what I'm learning, what works, what doesn't. The people I want to work with understand that. Everyone else probably isn't a fit anyway.</p>
