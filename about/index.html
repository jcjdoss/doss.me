                <p>This site was built with AI assistance. The writing was refined by AI. The code was generated through conversation with AI tools.</p>
                <p>I'm explicit about this because hiding it seems pointless. AI is a tool. I use tools that help me work more effectively.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ideas and direction</strong> — mine</li>
                    <li><strong>Writing and organization</strong> — AI-assisted from my input</li>
                    <li><strong>Code and implementation</strong> — AI-generated from my requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Final review</strong> — me, checking that it actually represents what I mean</li>

            <h2>Why Transparency</h2>
            <div class="importance-content">
                <p>Most people obscure their AI usage. I don't see the point.</p>
                <p>Using AI well is a skill. The people I'd want to work with understand that. The people who would judge me for being honest about my tools are probably not people I need to impress.</p>
                <p>I'm more interested in outcomes than in performing effort.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="authenticity-content">
                <p>I'm J. I'm 51. I live in Oakhurst, California—a small town in the Sierra foothills near Yosemite.</p>
                <p>I've worked in IT for over a decade, currently managing Client Services for Madera County government. Before that I ran my own freelance business for almost twenty years.</p>
                <p>I'm married to Chrissie. We have two adult sons. I like cooking—Traeger, sous vide—and building iOS apps when I have time.</p>
                <p>I tend toward optimism. Every day is an opportunity. I don't worship weekends or dread Mondays. Work is just another part of life, and I try to make all of it worthwhile.</p>
