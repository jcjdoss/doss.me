                    <p>For years I didn't post on social media. Not because I had controversial takes - just tech thoughts, family photos, vacation pics. But the higher I moved up, the more I felt like everything could be "used against me later."</p>
                    <p>That's not risk assessment. That's anxiety cosplaying as strategy.</p>
                    <p>The math: theoretical risk of posting normal human content = ~0. Actual cost of years of silence = no voice, no network, no presence.</p>
                    <p>I'm not running for office. I'm not handling classified intel. I'm a tech guy who likes Traegers and builds iOS apps. The version of me that stayed silent was protecting against a threat that doesn't exist.</p>

                    <p>THE INTERRUPTION PROBLEM: Every notification is cognitive overhead. Every ping breaks flow. Every "quick question" costs 20 minutes to recover from.</p>
                    <p>ADHD brains don't have spare cycles. We run at 100% or 0%. There's no idle state.</p>
                    <p>Solution: Agent as gatekeeper. Filter the noise. Batch the interruptions. Present the signal when I choose to receive it, not when the world decides to send it.</p>

                    <p>Team meeting today. Someone said "let's circle back" about a decision we should have made three weeks ago. Classic executive dysfunction at the organizational level.</p>
                    <p>Companies have ADHD too. Shiny new initiatives. Forgotten commitments. Meetings about meetings about meetings.</p>
