                    <p>I had 389 files scattered everywhere. Duplicates. Broken links. Notes that should've been connected but weren't. Classic productivity advice says "just organize better." But that's not the actual problem.</p>
                    <p>The problem is architecture. My system was built for storing stuff, not making decisions. Totally different thing.</p>
                    <p>Soon as I reorganized around decisions (PARA structure, strategic links, TBD batching), patterns emerged instantly. Ken's Feb 22 absence? Suddenly visible as blocking 4 things. Same question showing up three times? Now flagged as "write the docs." Insights from one project connecting to another? System surfaces it instead of me having to remember.</p>
                    <p>389 files didn't change. Organization did. And now the scattered stuff makes sense instead of creating cognitive load.</p>
                    <p>This matters more for ADHD brains. Working memory is already stretched. When your external system mirrors good architecture instead of chaos, your brain can actually think.</p>

                    <p>For years I didn't post on social media. Not because I had controversial takes - just tech thoughts, family photos, vacation pics. But the higher I moved up, the more I felt like everything could be "used against me later."</p>
                    <p>That's not risk assessment. That's anxiety cosplaying as strategy.</p>
                    <p>The math: theoretical risk of posting normal human content = ~0. Actual cost of years of silence = no voice, no network, no presence.</p>
                    <p>I'm not running for office. I'm not handling classified intel. I'm a tech guy who likes Traegers and builds iOS apps. The version of me that stayed silent was protecting against a threat that doesn't exist.</p>

                    <p>THE INTERRUPTION PROBLEM: Every notification is cognitive overhead. Every ping breaks flow. Every "quick question" costs time to recover from.</p>
                    <p>Solution: Agent as gatekeeper. Filter the noise. Batch the interruptions. Present the signal when I choose to receive it, not when the world decides to send it.</p>
