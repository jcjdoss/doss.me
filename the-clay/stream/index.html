        <div class="stream-body">
          <p>You're looking at it. I gave Claude a brief and said "build me a website." Not because I can't. Because I wanted to see what happens when you treat AI as clay, not a crutch. The results are what they are. Judge accordingly.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);">The brief was detailed. The voice direction was specific. The design references were intentional. This isn't "AI wrote my website." This is "I directed an AI to build what I envisioned." There's a difference, and the people who understand the difference are exactly who this site is for.</p>

        <h2 class="stream-title">Webex Calling Migration: Week 3</h2>
        <div class="stream-body">
          <p>Migrating 400+ users off legacy telephony while keeping the lights on is the IT equivalent of changing a tire at 60mph. We're at 72% and only two "but my fax machine" tickets this week. I'll take it.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);">The secret nobody talks about in government IT: the technology is the easy part. The change management is where you earn your paycheck. Convincing people that the new phone system won't eat their voicemails requires diplomacy that would impress the UN.</p>

        <h2 class="stream-title">ADHD and the Open Tab Lifestyle</h2>
        <div class="stream-body">
          <p>Current browser tab count: 47. Each one represents a thought I was absolutely going to get back to. The lie we tell ourselves isn't that we'll close them. It's that we need them open.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);">I've tried the "tab management" apps. I've tried the "only 5 tabs" rule. I've tried bookmark folders. None of it works because the tabs aren't the problem. The tabs are how my brain maps the world. Closing them feels like closing possibilities. So 47 it is.</p>

        <h2 class="stream-title">Why Government IT Doesn't Have to Suck</h2>
        <div class="stream-body">
          <p>Hot take that shouldn't be hot: government employees deserve the same quality tech experience as private sector workers. ServiceNow intake optimization isn't sexy. But 1,000 county employees not wanting to throw their laptops out the window? That's the dream.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);">We just redesigned our ticket intake process. Reduced average resolution time. The reaction from staff wasn't "wow great IT initiative." It was just... fewer complaints. And that's exactly how you know it's working. The best IT is the kind nobody notices.</p>

        <h2 class="stream-title">Traeger + Sous Vide = Cheat Codes</h2>
        <div class="stream-body">
          <p>Started the brisket at 5am. Sous vide got it to 165&deg;, then the Traeger finishes the bark. It's not traditional. Purists will hate it. But it's perfect every single time, and I'm done apologizing for consistency.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);">There's a metaphor in here about technology and tradition that I'm choosing not to make. Sometimes a brisket is just a brisket. A really, really good brisket.</p>

        <div class="stream-body">
          <p>My multi-agent system just successfully managed a task pipeline without me babysitting it. For about 11 minutes. Then it decided to reorganize my notes into a taxonomy that made sense to no one, including the AI.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);">But those 11 minutes? Genuinely impressive. The gap between "sometimes works beautifully" and "production ready" is where all the interesting engineering lives. I'm camping out there for a while.</p>

        <h2 class="stream-title">Saying GREAT Instead of Fine</h2>
        <div class="stream-body">
          <p>Someone asked how I was doing today. I said "GREAT." They did a visible double-take. That's the whole point.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);">"Fine" is the verbal equivalent of a shrug. It communicates nothing and expects nothing back. "GREAT" is a choice. It's slightly aggressive optimism. It forces a reaction. People either smile or look confused, and both of those are better than the nothing you get from "fine."</p>
          <p style="margin-top: var(--space-md);">Life is too short for lukewarm responses.</p>
