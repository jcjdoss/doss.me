Future employers can see the whole picture: self-aware about challenges, builds solutions instead of complaining, thinks in public.\n\nAuthentic beats polished corporate veneer every time.",

But the higher I moved up, the more I felt like everything could be \"used against me later.\"\n\nThat's not risk assessment. That's anxiety cosplaying as strategy.\n\nThe math: theoretical risk of posting normal human content = ~0. Actual cost of years of silence = no voice, no network, no presence.\n\nI'm not running for office. I'm not handling classified intel. I'm a tech guy who likes Traegers and builds iOS apps. The version of me that stayed silent was protecting against a threat that doesn't exist.",
