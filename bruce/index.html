                    <p>15+ years helping organizations move from <mark>chaos to clarity</mark>—through systems design, honest AI adoption, and teams that thrive with autonomy.</p>
                    <p>I think in systems because of how my brain works, not despite it. Different perspectives solve problems homogeneous teams miss.</p>
                    <p>This is where I share how I think—transparent about what actually works in AI, infrastructure, and team dynamics. Not the hype.</p>

                <h3>AI Agent System</h3>
                <p>Built a multi-agent system that <mark>reaches out to me</mark> instead of making me remember to check in. One agent tracks tasks and surfaces patterns. Another reminds me time exists. A third organizes scattered thoughts into coherent output.</p>
                <p>They don't wait. They interrupt when it matters.</p>
                <p class="meta">Built on OpenClaw. First iteration was too noisy; second was useful. Still iterating.</p>
