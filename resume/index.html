            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <div class="summary">
                <p>I lead Client Services for Madera County IT. My team keeps 1,000+ county employees connected, supported, and not yelling at their computers. It's great work - government tech gets a bad rap, but we're doing genuinely cool modernization stuff.</p>
                <p>I'm smart enough to know what I don't know, so I build systems and use tools to fill the gaps. I'm also convinced most problems are people problems wearing technology costumes.</p>
                <p><em>Yes, I used AI to help write this. I use lots of tools. That's kind of my thing.</em></p>
