            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <div class="summary">
                <p>I lead the Client Services Division for Madera County's Office of Information Technology, where my team keeps County operations connected, supported, and secure. My focus is improving how staff experience technology — simplifying processes, strengthening infrastructure, and delivering reliable service County-wide.</p>
                <p>I'm passionate about building trust across departments and leading teams through clear communication, collaboration, and practical execution.</p>
                <p>I have ADHD. Instead of hiding it, I'm building AI systems that externalize executive function. I'm smart enough to know what I don't know, and I build tools to fill the gaps.</p>
