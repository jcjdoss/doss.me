            <p>I run IT for Madera County. I also build stuff on the side because building stuff is great. Right now I'm really into AI agents - not to replace humans, but because they're genuinely useful tools and I like useful tools.</p>
            <p>I'm smart enough to know what I don't know. <span class="highlight">So I build tools to fill the gaps.</span></p>

                    <p>For years I didn't post on social media. Not because I had controversial takes - just tech thoughts, family photos, vacation pics. But the higher I moved up, the more I felt like everything could be "used against me later."</p>
                    <p>That's not risk assessment. That's anxiety cosplaying as strategy.</p>
                    <p>The math: theoretical risk of posting normal human content = ~0. Actual cost of years of silence = no voice, no network, no presence.</p>
                    <p>I'm not running for office. I'm not handling classified intel. I'm a tech guy who likes Traegers and builds iOS apps. The version of me that stayed silent was protecting against a threat that doesn't exist.</p>
