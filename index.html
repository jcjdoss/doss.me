                <h3>AI Agent System</h3>
                <p>I built a multi-agent system that actually <mark>reaches out to me</mark> instead of making me remember to check in. Sounds simple—changes everything in practice.</p>
                <p>One agent tracks my tasks and surfaces patterns I've missed. Another reminds me time exists. A third helps me organize scattered thoughts into coherent output. They don't wait. They interrupt when it matters.</p>

            <blockquote class="pull-quote">I have hyperfocus. Unfortunately, it's hyperfocused on not doing the thing.</blockquote>
            <p>15+ years helping organizations move from <mark>chaos to clarity</mark>—through systems design, honest AI adoption, and teams that thrive with autonomy. I think in systems because of how my brain works, not despite it. ADHD perspective solves problems homogeneous teams miss.</p>
            <p>This site is where I share how I think. Public building on doss.me, <mark>@whatmefocus</mark>, and my thinking notebook. Transparent about what actually works in AI, infrastructure, and team dynamics—not the hype.</p>

                    <p>Most people think organization is about prettiness. Neat folders. Consistent naming. Visual harmony. That's decoration, not design. Real organization is about <mark>enabling decisions</mark>. When your external system mirrors good decision-making structure, your internal processes can focus on synthesis, creativity, and strategic thinking.</p>

                    <p>For years I avoided posting publicly. Not because I had controversial opinions—just normal tech observations, family events, the usual. But the further I advanced professionally, the more everything felt like potential liability.</p>
                    <p>Looking back, that wasn't risk management. It was <mark>anxiety dressed up as prudence</mark>.</p>
                    <p>The actual math: risk of sharing normal professional content is near zero. Cost of years of silence is a missing network, no public presence, no voice in conversations that matter.</p>
                    <p>I'm not in politics. I'm not handling sensitive information. I'm an IT manager who builds apps and cooks on a Traeger. The careful silence was protecting against a threat that never existed.</p>
