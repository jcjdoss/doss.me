            <p>I lead IT Client Services for Madera County, supporting the technology needs of County departments and staff. On the side, I <mark>build tools</mark> and experiment with AI systems.</p>
            <p>This site is where I share work in progress, thoughts on technology, and occasional notes on building things. Some content is written with AI assistance—my ideas, better organized.</p>

                    <p>For years I avoided posting publicly. Not because I had controversial opinions—just normal tech observations, family events, the usual. But the further I advanced professionally, the more everything felt like potential liability.</p>
                    <p>Looking back, that wasn't risk management. It was <mark>anxiety dressed up as prudence</mark>.</p>
                    <p>The actual math: risk of sharing normal professional content is near zero. Cost of years of silence is a missing network, no public presence, no voice in conversations that matter.</p>
                    <p>I'm not in politics. I'm not handling sensitive information. I'm an IT manager who builds apps and cooks on a Traeger. The careful silence was protecting against a threat that never existed.</p>
